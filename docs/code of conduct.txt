# Contributor Code of Conduct for FileLocker

Welcome to **FileLocker**!

This document outlines the rules and best practices for all contributors—whether you're coding or translating—to help keep the project clean, maintainable, and accessible for everyone.

---

## General Guidelines

- Treat all contributors with respect, regardless of their role.  
- Be open to feedback and different perspectives.  
- Communicate clearly and concisely.  
- Don’t commit broken or untested code.  
- Avoid submitting unrelated or unnecessary files.  

---

## For Coders

Let’s keep the codebase organized and easy to navigate.

### File Structure Rules (Example)

- All Python UI code should go into `ui.py`.  
- Translation files are stored in the `locales/` folder.  
- You may create additional files (e.g., `a.py`, `b.py`, etc.) if needed, as long as it improves clarity and maintainability.  

### Coding Guidelines

- Follow the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) Python style guide.  
- Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables and functions.  
- Keep functions and classes short and focused on a single responsibility.  
- Avoid hardcoding translatable strings—wrap them with `_()`.  
- Separate UI logic from core functionality.  
- Avoid circular imports and overly coupled components.  
- Use relative imports within modules when appropriate.

## For Translators

Thanks for helping make FileLocker more accessible in different languages!

### Translation Guidelines

- Only translate using the `messages.pot` or `en/messages.po` files.  
- Do not modify or add source strings directly in `.po` files.  
- Keep placeholders like `%s`, `{}` unchanged.  
- Match the original string’s punctuation and formatting.  
- Avoid adding personal branding, comments, or unrelated content.  

If a string’s meaning is unclear, feel free to reach out to the maintainer for clarification.

---

## Please Avoid

- Disrupting file structure or formatting on purpose.  
- Adding new features or languages without prior discussion.  
- Editing files outside your role (e.g., coders modifying translation files).  
- Pushing malicious, unstable, or non-functional code.  
- Breaking the build or translation system and leaving it unfixed.
